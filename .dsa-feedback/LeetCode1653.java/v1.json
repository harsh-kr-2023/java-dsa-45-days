    "optimal_approach": "- Technique: Prefix Sum\n- Idea: Create 2 arrays of prefix_b and suffix_a in one pass and then find the min cost\n- Why it works: If we know that at each index, we do have count of preceeding B and succeeding A then we dont have to calculate it each time.\n- Invariant: After traversing array twice, we do know at each index, what will be the cost of deletion\n-------------------------------------",

      "1. Can you elaborate on how you would use the prefix sum arrays to find the minimum cost? How do these arrays help in avoiding recalculations?",

      "3. If the input string contained characters other than 'a' and 'b', how would your optimal approach fail or need to be modified?"
