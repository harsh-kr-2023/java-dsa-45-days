      "- Brute Force approach is overly simplistic and lacks an understanding of algorithmic complexity. There's no mention about handling duplicates efficiently in a single pass, which could hint at their reasoning process being superficial for such problems involving duplicate detection. The optimal solution seems to be assumed rather than explicitly reasoned through by the candidate.",
      "- No edge cases are mentioned regarding arrays with repeated elements or all distinct elements – both scenarios should test fundamental understanding of constraints and assumptions in DSA interview settings, indicating a potential gap in problem analysis depth from the candidate's reasoning standpoint. Missing is also an exploration into why certain data structures (like HashSet) inherently solve such problems efficiently due to their properties which suggests missing comprehension on how algorithm design decisions are made based on trade-offs between time and space complexities, as well as understanding of the problem invariant within iterations through a loop.",
      "- No explicit mention or discussion about what happens when dealing with extremely large datasets that might not fit into memory (outside scope for this interview question), which is an implicit assumption in most algorithm design problems unless specifically stated otherwise – highlighting possible misconceptions about realistic constraints and assumptions during interviews, especially on DSA platforms.",
      "- Missing exploration into why this problem cannot be solved using simpler data structures or sorting methods to find duplicates since they are often the first considerations and if so, how their complexities compare — suggesting an incomplete knowledge of basic DSA strategies for duplicate detection problems like 'set'. This lack indicates a missed opportunity in showcasing breadth-first algorithmic thinking.",
